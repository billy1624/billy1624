## 👋 Hi, I am a

### Open Source Rust Developer

A core member of [SeaQL](https://github.com/SeaQL), who is developing and maintaining [SeaORM](https://github.com/SeaQL/sea-orm), [SeaQuery](https://github.com/SeaQL/sea-query) and [SeaSchema](https://github.com/SeaQL/sea-schema) and is actively engaged with all Rustaceans.

### Software Engineer

With over 6 years of experience in full stack development: starting from collecting requirements from end-user and defining the requirement specifications including user interfaces and database schemas, then implementing and testing both frontend and backend, finally releasing the MVP for production and maintaining it for years to come.

### HKUST Computer Science Graduate

I graduated from [HKUST](https://hkust.edu.hk/) in 2020, major in Computer Science and minor in Big Data Technology.

My final year project is [USmarTpark: Smart Parking Lot with Real-time Space Monitoring](https://youtu.be/y0ldZsfVBLY), which aims to convert existing HKUST parking lots into Smart Parking lots. Sensors are used to determine which spots in the parking lot are occupied and which are available for parking.

## 💻 My Leadership Style

I am an ENFJ, and according to [Personality Central](https://personality-central.com/personality_types/enfj-leadership/):

> ENFJs are idealistic and perfectionist. They have an ideal they envision, and they will strive to achieve them.
> 
> ENFJs are passionate, articulate and charismatic leaders who can rally people around a common cause.
> 
> Their desire for personal development also means that they will seek opportunities to help their staff develop.
