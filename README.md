### HKUST Computer Science Graduate

I graduated from [HKUST](https://hkust.edu.hk/) in 2020, major in Computer Science and minor in Big Data Technology.

My final year project is [USmarTpark: Smart Parking Lot with Real-time Space Monitoring](https://youtu.be/y0ldZsfVBLY), which aims to convert existing HKUST parking lots into Smart Parking lots. Sensors are used to determine which spots in the parking lot are occupied and which are available for parking.
