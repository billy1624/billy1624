A fresh graduate from the Computer Science Bachelor’s Degree Program at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.

I am passionate about delivering tailor-made and user-friendly applications and collaborating with different parties to improve applications’ user experience. I have worked in “Jou Sun” for three consecutive years as a web developer summer intern. My responsibilities in this role included transforming an Excel-based workflow into a web-based order management system, assisting their marketing team in launching promotion campaign and working with their design team to iteratively improve the user interface of their e-commerce platform.

I have the following experience:
- Full Stack Development: Four years of relevant internship experience, from designing and prototyping a web application to maintaining it in an agile manner
- Innovation and Initiative: Actively looking for areas to improve during internships, streamlining internal operations workflow and improving the customer experience on an e-commerce platform
- Collaboration: Cooperating with colleagues on different teams and executing new initiatives with the marking and design teams

My development skill set includes creating UI wireframes and prototypes for product owners to review before implementation, building web applications backed by PHP (CodeIgniter, Laravel or Yii) and MySQL and developing responsive frontend user interfaces with JavaScript (jQuery), CSS (Bootstrap and LESS) and HTML. Furthermore, I am currently gaining experience using React.js, Node.js and Java in my final year project to develop an on-campus smart parking system.
